# Ozzie's Office-Environment COVID Mitigation Strategy

**The following is a strategy for restricting COVID spread in an office environment. I personally follow this strategy and offer it in my personal capacity; it reflects neither the policy nor opinion of any employer of mine.**

*Last updated 2022-09-23*

## TL;DR
* COVID is rampant and I believe we have both a business interest and an ethical obligation to restrict its spread in the office
* When the [CDC Community Transmission level](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=all_states&list_select_county=all_counties&data-type=Risk&null=Risk) is **Substantial** (**Medium** if risk-averse) or higher in a given office location, I wear a high-quality mask when near others or in conference rooms and test as close to weekly as possible

## Background

* COVID is airborne
  * [Transmitted primarily through aerosols in breath](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8721651/)
  * [Aerosols can linger in air for several hours and be transmitted across spaces by air currents](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7954773/)
  * Can be transmitted by [fully-vaccinated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8554486/) and [asymptomatic people](https://jammi.utpjournals.press/doi/10.3138/jammi-2020-0030)
* COVID is highly transmissible
  * [Transmissibility increases with new variants](https://erictopol.substack.com/p/the-pandemic-and-the-boiling-frog)
  * [New variants promote reinfection and cause COVID to surge and recede](https://erictopol.substack.com/p/its-the-virus-stupid)
* While [most vaccinated individuals won't die from COVID](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7129e1.htm?s_cid=mm7129e1_w), getting it is still bad
  * [COVID cases tend to take more than a week to resolve](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/diagnosed-with-covid-19-what-to-expect#:~:text=How%20long%20do%20COVID%20symptoms,%2C%20kidneys%2C%20lungs%20and%20brain.)
  * [More than 10% of COVID cases result in prolonged symptoms lasting months or years](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7121e1.htm?s_cid=mm7121e1_w)
    * [Brain fog proves particularly durable](https://www.statnews.com/2022/08/17/risk-of-brain-fog-and-other-conditions-persists-up-to-two-years-after-covid-infection/)
  * [The later one gets COVID, the better treatments are and therefore the better outcomes are](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/avoid-covid-infection-17111911.php)
  * [The less frequently one gets COVID, the better the long-term outcomes](https://erictopol.substack.com/p/a-reinfection-red-flag)
* [Some health conditions (for example, immunosuppression and diabetes) worsen COVID outcomes](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html)
* COVID transmission can be reduced through non-medical means (Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions or NPIs)
  * [Masks](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7106e1.htm), [especially N95 respirators and similar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8084286/)
  * [Regular rapid testing](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abd5393)
  * [Ventilation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7255254/) (or staying outdoors)

## Motivation
* Absent company-wide requirements, individual action is necessary to keep COVID transmission low
* COVID transmission results in lost productivity
  * Active infections can take employees out of commission for more than a week
  * Chronic symptoms (especially fatigue and brain fog) can reduce employee effectiveness long-term
* Acting to mitigate transmission is respectful of colleagues and inclusive of those who are vulnerable

## Call to Action
* Whenever the [CDC Community Transmission level](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=all_states&list_select_county=all_counties&data-type=Risk&null=Risk)[^4] in the county where the office is located is **Substantial** or higher[^1], I take the following surge precautions
  * Wear a high-quality[^2] mask indoors if sitting near[^3] someone else or are sharing a conference room
  * Take a test weekly before coming into the office (or as close to weekly as possible, given test supplies)
  * If suspecting exposure or simply concerned about transmission, bias towards working from home
* For my personal risk calculus, I am likely to continue with these precautions if CDC Community Transmission is **Medium**, but it's not unreasonable to be less cautious at that level
* Every week, I check the [CDC Data Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=all_states&list_select_county=all_counties&data-type=Risk&null=Risk) and will send an email to a listserv to update whether surge precautions are in effect
  * If you'd like to join me, add yourself to [ozzie-covid-mitigation-announce@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/u/0/g/ozzie-covid-mitigation-announce)
* Regardless of surge status, events should be held outdoors as much as possible

[^1]: If we assume that 4 out of every 5 positive tests are unreported due to at-home testing and that the average COVID infections last 2 weeks, this translates to a 12.5% chance that one people in a 25-person group has an active COVID infection.
[^2]: N95, KN95, KF94, FFP2, or P100
[^3]: "Near" isn't well-defined, but a useful working definition is within 15 feet/5 meters
[^4]: Not to be confused with Community Level, which measures hospital capacity
